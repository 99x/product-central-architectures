# ADR Structure

When writing Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), consider including the following sections:

1. **Title**: A short phrase describing the decision.

2. **Status**: The current status of the decision (e.g., proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded).

3. **Context**: The factors that influenced the decision and any constraints that were present.

4. **Decision**: The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement.

5. **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision, including both positive and negative consequences.

6. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were considered and why they were not chosen.

7. **References**: Any relevant sources of information that influenced the decision.
