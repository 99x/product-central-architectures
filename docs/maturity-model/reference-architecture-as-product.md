# Reference Architecture as Product

At this maturity level, Reference Architectures are treated as products with releases, new features, and bug fixes. Backward-incompatible releases may occur, requiring specific files within the code repository. Developer teams using a particular Reference Architecture can adopt new releases when feasible. Dedicated Platform teams maintain Reference Architectures, create documentation, release notes, and assist developer teams in adoption. Establishing feedback loops with the developer community is crucial for evolving Reference Architectures based on ongoing requirements.
