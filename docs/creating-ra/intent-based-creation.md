# Intent-Based Creation

The "intent-based" approach involves articulating the intention in a structured format from a developer's point of view:

"I want to [verb][adjective][noun]"

For example:
"I want to deploy a scalable Node.js, MongoDB application on Kubernetes."

This intent-based statement precisely articulates the objective, desired outcome, and specific technologies for deploying a scalable web application. It's a foundational step towards outlining a standardized reference architecture.
