# Submitting Changes

## Committing and Pushing Changes

1. **Commit Changes**: Once your changes are ready, commit them to your local repository.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your detailed commit message"
   ```
2. **Push Changes**: Push your commits to your forked repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Raising a Pull Request (PR)

- **PR Submission**: Navigate to the main repository and raise a Pull Request (PR) from your fork. This notifies the repository maintainers that your contribution is ready for review.

## PR Review Process

1. **Review by Leads**: The repository leads will review your PR.
2. **Approval**: If the PR meets the standards, it will be merged into the main branch.
3. **Changes Requested**: If changes are requested, address the feedback and push the updated changes to your fork.

## Completion

The contribution process is completed once your PR is merged into the main branch of the `99x/product-central-architectures` repository.

By following these steps, you can ensure a smooth contribution process that aligns with the standards and practices of Product Central. Your contributions are valuable and appreciated in enhancing the overall architecture templates.
