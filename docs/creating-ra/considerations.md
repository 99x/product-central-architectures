# Considerations While Building Reference Architectures

1. **Long-Term View**: Building a reference architecture is like developing a city's infrastructure. It's essential to take a long-term view rather than focusing on immediate needs.
   - Avoid building for day one. Developers often enhance existing services rather than build new ones. Therefore, focus on creating paths for day two operations, such as integrating additional features, security, and testing.
   
2. **Prioritization**: Not everything needs a reference architecture. Prioritize tasks that will have the most significant impact. 
   - Interact with developers to understand their critical tasks and monitor recent deployments to identify processes that need addressing. Focusing on these will yield the highest impact and ROI.
