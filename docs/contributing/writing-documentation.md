# Writing Documentation

## TechDocs
Use TechDocs to write thorough documentation explaining the template's purpose, usage, and any other relevant information. This documentation should be clear and concise to assist other contributors and users.

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
Document all architectural decisions using `mkdocs`. ADRs provide a structured format to capture the rationale behind technical choices, ensuring transparency and clarity.
