The **tools folder** in an Nx monorepo serves as a place to store various utilities and scripts that help manage your repository. Here's what you can typically find in the tools
folder:

1. **Workspace Schematics**: You can create custom workspace schematics (using `ng g workspace-schematic`) specific to your organization. These schematics allow you to enforce
   standards and generate code tailored to your needs.

2. **Non-Source Code and Non-Config Code**: Any code that doesn't belong to your app or library source code or configuration can reside here. For example:

    - **Database Scripts**: Scripts related to database migrations.
    - **Local Executors**: Custom scripts for local development tasks.
    - **CI Processes**: Automation scripts for continuous integration.

3. **Custom Linting Rules**: You can place custom linting rules or other code quality checks in the tools folder.
