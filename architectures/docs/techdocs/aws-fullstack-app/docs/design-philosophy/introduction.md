## Design Philosophy

The design concept behind this proposal is to improve the total experience, efficiency and appeal of the AWS Fullstack Application's Support Services by introducing improved user experiences, new features, efficient workflows while minimizing the technology management complexities of the organization (by maximally adhering to the existing mix of technologies). 

Another set goal of the project is to build the entire thing as a robust platform so that it caters not only to the current set of requirements but also to the future requirements which is yet to be uncovered.

Both frontend and the backend applications are designed while keeping modularity and reusability in mind. At the same time, we have  minimized the room to over design the solution by not going extreme on these design principles. Some decision are deferred until the requirement really pops up and can be justified with a business or a technical return.
