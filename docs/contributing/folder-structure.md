# Adhering to the Folder Structure

Ensure that you follow the prescribed folder structure. All contributions should be developed within the `github/` folder path. 

Refer to the [aws-fullstack-app](https://github.com/99x/product-central-architectures/tree/main/architectures/github/aws-fullstack-app) template as a primary example. 

Consistency in structure helps maintain clarity and organization across all contributions.
