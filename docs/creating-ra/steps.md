1. **Define Goals**: Understand the end goal of your reference architecture. What do you want to achieve?

2. **Choose Your Tools**: Engage with your end users (developers) to understand the tools they use daily.

3. **Research Best Practices**: Research industry standards and best practices for using the chosen tools and processes.

4. **Create a Prototype**: Using the gathered tools and best practices, create an initial version of the reference architecture.

5. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation of each step, tool usage, configuration settings, and best practices.

6. **Get Feedback and Iterate**: Share the prototype and documentation with your developers to gather feedback.

7. **Deploy to Product Central**: Once ready, deploy the reference architecture to Product Central as a template or guided walkthrough.
